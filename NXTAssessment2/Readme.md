# High-Level Architecture Description
# Front End:
Users: Interact with the application via web browsers or mobile devices.
Web Server: Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) using a CDN (Content Delivery Network) for faster delivery.

# Back End:
API Gateway: Routes requests to the appropriate microservices and handles tasks such as rate limiting, authentication, and logging.
Microservices: Each service handles a specific business function (either lambdas"serverless" or "containers")

# Databases:
Relational Database (RDS): Stores structured data such as user profiles, product details, and orders.
NoSQL Database (DynamoDB): Stores unstructured or semi-structured data, such as user activity logs or session data.

# Storage:
Object Storage (S3): Stores static files, user uploads, and backups.

# Caching:
In-Memory Cache (Redis): Caches frequently accessed data to reduce load on databases and improve performance.

# Networking Elements:
Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Provides network isolation and security for the application infrastructure.
Security Groups & Network ACLs: Control inbound and outbound traffic to resources within the VPC.

# Security:
IAM Roles and Policies: Manage permissions for AWS resources.
SSL/TLS: Ensures secure communication between users and the application.
